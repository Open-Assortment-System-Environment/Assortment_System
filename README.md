## __State__

This project is currently in the state to design the [boxes][3]

## __Plans__
The next steps after getting the [box][3] design to an state where all important things are finalized is to designed the drawers of an cabinet and an cabinet where the boxes are directly used as drawer. After that an cabinet will be designed around the drawers.  

I want to include into the drwaers 2 things:

1) An display and LED in to the front where you can say where is part xy and these wild light up.

2) LED in to one of the sides and in to the back or front to display witch box exactly has the wanted part.
